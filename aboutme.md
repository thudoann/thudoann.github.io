My name is Anh Thu, I am currently preparing a bachelor's degree in data sciences at CY Tech (Ex EISTI). And it is in this context that I am actively looking for a five months internship in Data Science starting from April to September 2023 with the possibility of extending it to an apprenticeship for one year after that.
